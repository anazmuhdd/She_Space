# Project Name

This repository contains the code for [Project Name], a [brief description of the project]. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment, install required packages, and run the server.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Node.js** (Version 16 or later recommended)
2. **MongoDB** (Ensure the MongoDB server is running locally or provide a remote connection string)
3. **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of this GitHub repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd <project_directory>/backend
```

Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the cloned repository.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you are in the root directory of the project, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Configuration

### MongoDB Connection

1. If you are using a local MongoDB server, ensure it is running on your machine.
2. Update the `MONGO_URI` in the `config.js` or `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string.

For example:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/<database_name>
```

Replace `<database_name>` with the name of your database.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
```

Replace `<your_mongo_connection_string>` and `<your_secret_key>` with your actual MongoDB connection string and a secure secret key.

## Running the Server

### Start the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:5000` unless a different `PORT` is specified in the `.env` file.

### Running in Development Mode

For development, use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server when changes are detected:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Application

1. Open your browser or a tool like Postman.
2. Access the endpoints defined in your application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/<endpoint>`).

## Additional Scripts

### Linting

To check for linting issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Fix Linting Issues
